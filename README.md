# SendMessageFormTest

This project is for unit testing of "Send Message" functionality on contact page located here: https://bluescapeqainterview.wordpress.com/contact/
There are 4 unit tests performed using Codecept with Playwright:
1. To check if "Name" field is required
2. To check if "Email" field is required
3. The check if "Website" field is required to be a URL
4. Verify that once all fields are entered correctly, the "Send Message" form is sent/accepted (happy path)
